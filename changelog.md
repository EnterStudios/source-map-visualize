### Version 2.0.0 (2016-02-28) ###

- Changed: If a source cannot be found a “dummy source” is created for it. Then,
  the tool continues with the rest of the sources. This allows for visualizing
  as much as possible even if one or some sources are missing.
- Improved: Error messages. When something goes wrong, as much information as is
  available is presented, making it easier to debug.
- Improved: sourceMappingURL comments are now found even if they’re not at the
  very end of files.
